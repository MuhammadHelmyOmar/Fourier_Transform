# Key Actions
- Designed and implemented Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms to
perform polynomial multiplication, leveraging a divide-and-conquer strategy.
- Demonstrated the transition from naive O(nÂ²) polynomial multiplication to the more efficient O(nlogn) FFT-
based approach, documenting the process using LaTeX.
- Constructed an Inverse FFT (IFFT) pipeline for reconstructing coefficient representations, ensuring numerical
stability and accuracy in the transformation-reconstruction process.
- Applied FFT to analyze and visualize a noisy signal, illustrating its effectiveness in transforming and identifying
frequency components.
